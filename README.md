# Lego_Car_Code

This is my code for my freshmen FSE 100 project. We used a Lego Mindstorms EVE3 kit to make a car that can traverse a maze using the different sensors. The car traverses the maze by following the wall on its right and following the maze until it finishes. Another notable thing about this project is that the car is able to self-correct making it able to go faster allowing us to get the fastest time in the class.
